        <p>We are a group of 8th grade students from Wellesley Middle School from Wellesley Massachusetts! our goal is to get air conditioning more involved in our public schools and to hopefully get air conditioning in more than just our school. We have been researching the effects and issues that come with improper ventilation and or no air conditioning.
